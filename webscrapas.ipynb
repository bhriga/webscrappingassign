    "Q1. What is Web Scraping? Why is it Used? Give three areas where Web Scraping is used to get data.\n",
    "\n",
    "answer:\n",
    "Web scraping is the process of automatically extracting data from websites. It involves fetching web pages, parsing the HTML content,\n",
    "and then extracting the desired information. This extracted data can then be saved into a structured format like a spreadsheet or database\n",
    "for further analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Web scraping is used for various purposes including:\n",
    "\n",
    "Market Research and Competitive Analysis: Companies often use web scraping to gather data about their competitors, market trends, pricing information,\n",
    "    and customer sentiments from various sources such as e-commerce websites, social media platforms, and forums.\n",
    "\n",
    "Content Aggregation: Content aggregators and news websites use web scraping to collect articles, blog posts, and other content from multiple sources \n",
    "    across the web. This helps them provide a centralized platform for users to access diverse information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lead Generation: Businesses employ web scraping to gather contact information (such as email addresses and phone numbers) of potential leads from\n",
    "websites like LinkedIn, business directories, and other sources. This data can then be used for marketing and sales purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Financial Data Analysis: Financial institutions and individual investors utilize web scraping to gather real-time or historical financial data from \n",

    "save the results in a structured format. Examples of such tools include BeautifulSoup (Python library), Scrapy (Python framework), and \n",
    "Octoparse (standalone software).\n",
    "\n",
    "Using APIs (Application Programming Interfaces): Many websites offer APIs that allow developers to access their data in a structured format \n",
    "without the need for web scraping. By querying these APIs, developers can retrieve the desired data directly in a machine-readable format,\n",
    "which is often more efficient and reliable than scraping HTML content. However, not all websites offer APIs, and accessing them may require \n",
    "authentication or payment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Headless Browsers: Headless browsers like Puppeteer (for Node.js) or Selenium (for various programming languages) can be used for web scraping by\n",
    "simulating a web browser and interacting with web pages programmatically. This method allows for dynamic content rendering and interaction with \n",
    "JavaScript-heavy websites, which may not be possible with traditional scraping techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reverse Engineering APIs: In some cases, when APIs are not publicly available or insufficient for the desired data, developers resort to reverse \n",
    "engineering the website's endpoints and protocols to mimic API requests. This method involves analyzing network traffic, inspecting browser developer\n",
    "tools, and experimenting with different parameters to understand how the website communicates with its server."

    "Q4. Why is flask used in this Web Scraping project?\n",
    "\n",
    "answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "Flask is a micro web framework for Python, primarily used for building web applications. While it might not seem directly related to web scraping,\n",
    "Flask can be used in conjunction with web scraping projects for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating Web Interfaces: Flask allows developers to create web interfaces or dashboards for their web scraping projects. This is particularly \n",
    "useful when the scraped data needs to be presented to users in a user-friendly manner, or when users need to interact with the scraping process, \n",
    "such as providing input parameters or downloading the scraped data.\n",
